# gmpublish-ci
Tool that allows to use GMPublish on servers

# Usage
This works just like GMPublish with the difference that this will perform a logon on Steam, so you are not required to start Steam to use GMPublish with this tool.

Using it just works like GMPublish with a few additional parameters.
```
gmpublish-ci -user 'yoursteamuser' -pass 'yoursteampass' update -addon "your.gma" -icon "icon.jpg" -id <workshopid> -changes "Something new"
```
